Essentially real-time presentation generation. This new product gives a personal touch to the LLM as you no longer have to communicate with AI models via chat messages, there's a face now to the model and it can show information naturally just like a person would present it. This has the potential to disrupt fields like search, teaching, marketing and sales enablement and many more.",

          "content": "Apart from coming up with the initial product pitch the most exciting part of the project was understanding how information is visualised when there's a 'human' presenter involved. Topics for example are presented around the presenter in circular bubbles where bubbles can also go partially behind the presenter (without obstructing or hiding information) emphasising that they are situated in space. They can also be clicked allowing you to advance the conversation and have wobble physics so they gently move as you move your cursor over them. This makes information a living and interactive part of the whole experience.",

The next step in the user journey was choosing a template that would define the look of the video. For this part I reworked the template selector and introduced sorting options by identifying the most important characteristics users were looking by looking at our data metrics. After that there was a fairly long loading process, to make this step more engaging I created a tips & tricks slideshow that would surface useful hints in video format while the user was waiting. Here the tips shown were selected based on what brings the most user value towards our activation metric.",

Upon user testing this solution and user intel coming in from corporate clients we realised that we needed something much simpler as the only thing that mattered is to apply the brand kit and quickly if possible. Unfortunately this information only came at a later date but I learned a lot from this initial prototype. It made me realise how quickly this feature can get complicated and what parts should and could be automated.",

I also introduced a smart apply button that did all of this in one click by identifying what colors worked the best for the background and CTA color.
